**Describe the bug**
When accesing the "E" garage by legion and selecting my tow truck, it will not spawn, and when tryign to access the garage again it will no longer show "E" to access list vehicles either, and would not allow you to take out any other vehicle.



**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Go to 'Garage E'
2. Click on 'vehicles'
3. Scroll down to 'tow truck'
4. See error

**Expected behavior**
i expected to receive my tow truck, and have access to my vehicles

**Screenshots**
If applicable, add screenshots to help explain your problem.

**Additional context**
i would like to inform that i have checked my vechicles to make sure they arent at the impound/in another garage i would like that to be clear that after tryign to take out the tow truck it does the same action every single time i access to the city, and i verified multiple times that it isnt anywhere else. i also have a video demostrating the issue
